This project requires two arduinos, talking over i2c. 

To build it, put aarrgghham_eye on one Arduino and aarrgghhcam_singer on the other. 

Connect them over i2c (analog 4 to analog 4, analog5 to analog5)

If you don't have a suitable line camera handy, replace aarrgghhcam_eye with aarrgghhcam_simulated_eye.
